# Reinforcement-learning
Some implementations of reinforcement learning algorithms on few gym environments. All ipynb 
notebooks just need to be run. I used google colab. Please email me if you have any problems
getting it to work. 

taxi_gym.ipynb: Q-learning implementation on the simple taxi-v3 environment
dqn_cartpole.ipynb: Implementation of Deep Q-learning(DQN) with continuous states (no CNN) on Cartpole environment
cnn_cartpole.ipynb: Implementation of DQN with raw pixels (CNN) on Cartpole environment
cnn_breakout.ipynb: Initial implementation of DQN with CNN on Atari Breakout (states are raw pixels)
deep_q_network_breakout: Modular implementation of DQN with CNN on Atari Breakout (includes option for Double DQN or Dueling architecture)
